# slideshow-js
This project to create slideshow images using JavaScript. We have four buttons each one has its own function, for example <b>Previous</b> button to show the previous picture, <b>Next</b> button to show the next picture, <b>Slideshow</b> button to show all the pictures as a sequence to show one picture every 0.4 seconds and <b>Stop</b> button to stop the slide show.<br>
